## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

- Web browser
- Code Editor
- Live Server Extension

### Linter Setup:

#### Set-up GitHub Actions

- Create a `.github/workflows` folder and add a copy of [`.github/workflows/linters.yml`](.github/workflows/linters.yml) to that folder.

#### Set-up linters in your local env

- The npm package manager is going to create a `node_modules` directory to install all of your dependencies. You shouldn't commit that directory. To avoid that, you can create a `.gitignore` file and add `node_modules` to it as below:

    ```
    node_modules/
    ```

#### Webhint

- Run `npm install --save-dev hint@6.x`
- Copy [`.hintrc`](.hintrc) to the root directory of your project.

#### Stylelint

- Run `npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x`
- Copy [`.stylelintrc.json`](.stylelintrc.json) to the root directory of your project.

#### For Sass
If you prefer to work with SCSS files, you need to perform a few modifications to the linter configuration files:
  - In the file `linters.yml` [line 48](.github/workflows/linters.yml) replace `"**/*.{css,scss}"` with `"**/*.scss"`
  - Use `npx stylelint "**/*.scss"` to lint you SCSS files and not the generated CSS

### Cloning the repo to your local system (If you already have git, installed in your system):

- [Copy this link](https://vagyasri.github.io/Events-Directory/)
- Open your terminal or command line
- Run "git clone [Paste this link](https://vagyasri.github.io/Events-Directory/)"
- Open the folder with your code editor
- Now You can edit the code and check the changes in the browser using Live Server

### Check linter errors:

- Install npm: `npm install`
- For HTML: Run `npx hint .`
- For CSS: Run `npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"`
